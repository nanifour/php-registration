# PHP login and Registration Forms

[Demo the website](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~dhollowa/royalpup-php/)



Php login and registration forms. Logout by resetting the session. Members are only able to add events. I did this by checking the session to see if the username is valid. I used bootstrap to style the input fields and buttons. The menu and form was styled using css. For saving the login and event information, i used SQLite3 for the database. The password was also hashed using php. 


## Technologies used
- PHP
